# 2020-progress
This is where I'll be updating my progress with JavaScript and React in 2020!

January goals:
- Read and implement exercises from Dave Ceddia's Pure React
- Finish Harvard CS50 course
- Build one app

Notes: 
1/2/20 - Worked through building a UI similar to Github's file list. Going to work tomorrow on rendering more UI samples in React.
